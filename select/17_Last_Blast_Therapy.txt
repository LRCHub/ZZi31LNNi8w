You knew this wouldn't last forever
You never thought you'd live to see it taken away
Another super-human chemical hero
A pocket full of change when it comes to pay

This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast

There go the shakes and staggers
You lose a nerve on this crumbling ladder
Can't feel your feet and your lungs are aching
Your self control's at the point of breaking

This is the last blast, baby

This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast

You knew this wouldn't last forever
You never thought you'd live to see it taken away
Another super-human chemicals hero
A pocket full of change when it comes to pay

This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast, baby
This is the last blast
