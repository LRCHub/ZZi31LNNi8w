We blast off
We blast off
. Coward now I pass on my back and knee
You can fly you can really hide ...
And I can see the star from where I have been
Cause . I can sit . we got that gathering
Yeah blast off blast off blast off
We are blowing up to the moon
Fly out to the ... throw money in the room
Blast off

. Night . get drunk . to the mice
Money power . how you want it
. Got higher than the sky above .
Take a look at me now . go harder
Than you ever did . I am gonna sacrifice . let me be precise
Hustle hustle . turn up turn up turn up . to the moon
Any time . back on me . and I can see the stars from what happened

Blast off blast off
We are blowing up to the moon
Fly out to the ... throw money in the room
Blast off

. I don't never see no . stay sharper than a riser
My campaign manager excuse my behavior
. Betray us forgive my . my shoes got . profit
... I can fly a pelican . see you dremain up in the club
The bitch is screaming . next to a star
She wanna be famous.
I can see the stars from where I am . got that gathering

Blast off blast off
We are blowing up to the moon
Fly out to the ... throw money in the room
Blast off
