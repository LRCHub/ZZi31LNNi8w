Blast off, up to the stars we go
And leave behind everything I used to know
Somebody's giving me a whole lot of money to do
What I think I want to
So why am I still feeling blue?
Ohh, Wuan and Dondo
Goddamn, get your head out of your hands
Here's to all the times we're gonna have
Cooped up for a year with the two best-looking babes I've seen all year
Get me another bottle of beer
'Cause I'm feeling
Go ahead, waste your head
We've got the time
I hope you don't object if I
Speak my mind
Don't forget the purpose of the mission
Or Nomis will be swallowed by its sun
Each one of you is a top graduate of the Star Corps Academy
It's up to you reach for a dream
Ohh, Wuan and Dondo
Go ahead and waste your life
I'm still in fear
I hope you don't object if I
Crack another beer, yeah
Hold on, who is it here that I see?
Wasn't she a she a favorite bitch in the Academy?
I don't know if I wanna lead on this woman
You know I've done that before
She's actually a good girl
Or at least a cheap ho
